## Challenges

### RETS

The Real Estate Transaction Standard (RETS) is a technology used to
exchange standardized real estate data between clients and the Multiple
Listing Service (MLS).

This is an old standard and it has been almost entirely replaced in the US,
but unfortunately still used in Canada.

Working with the RETS server from these MLS systems require a RETS client
library on the application side to fetch new listings and corresponding
media. But since this system is old and hardly used in bigger real estate
boards, the ecosystem of client libraries are limited and often way out of
date.
