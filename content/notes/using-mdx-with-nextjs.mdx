[MDX](https://mdxjs.com/) is a superset of markdown that allows you to use
JSX in your markdown files. You can import and embed components in your
content to add interactivity to your otherwise static markdown.

### Why Markdown?

Markdown often feels more natural to type, its brief syntax can enable you
to write content that is both readable and maintainable. Markdown typically
looks more like what's intended. So instead of the following HTML:

```html
<blockquote>
  <p>A blockquote with <em>some</em> emphasis.</p>
</blockquote>
```

you can write:

```markdown
> A blockquote with _some_ emphasis.
```

However, markdown is essentially static content, where MDX shines is in its
ability to let you use your React components directly in the markup.

### Under the Hood

Internally MDX uses remark and rehype.
[Remark](https://unifiedjs.com/explore/package/remark/) is a markdown
processor powered by plugins. Plugins allow you to transform the processed
markdown. [Rehype](https://unifiedjs.com/explore/package/rehype/) is an
HTML processor, also powered by plugins. Similar to remark, these plugins
let you compile and transform your content.

## Using MDX with Next.js

Generally speaking, There are two ways you can integrate MDX into your
NextJS project that mainly depends on your data source (where your content
is stored) and how you're planning to use components inside your MDX files
(more on this later).

For local files (stored in the local file system), you can use the
`@next/mdx` package from NextJS team. This allows you to create pages
directly with the `.mdx` extension inside your `pages/` folder.

For remote data (stored in a database or a CMS), you can use
`next-mdx-remote` package (a third-party package) to fetch data inside
`getStaticProps` or `getServerSideProps`.

Let's look at implementing each package in more details.

## `@next/mdx`

As mentioned above, the `@next/mdx` package sources data from local files,
allowing you to create pages with a `.mdx` extension, directly in your
`/pages` directory.

The following steps are directly from
[NextJS documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/advanced-features/using-mdx)

1. Install the required packages:

```bash
  npm install @next/mdx @mdx-js/loader
```

2. Configure NextJS to support top level `.mdx` pages:

```js showLineNumbers title="next.config.js"
const withMDX = require('@next/mdx')({
  extension: /\.mdx?$/,
  options: {
    remarkPlugins: [],
    rehypePlugins: []
  }
})

module.exports = withMDX({
  pageExtensions: ['ts', 'tsx', 'js', 'jsx', 'md', 'mdx']
})
```

3.  Create a new `.mdx` page in the `/pages` folder or `/pages/blog` as an
    example and that's it, you can start writing content and your pages
    will be served at the corresponding route.

### Using Components

You can now use a React component directly inside your MDX page. Note that
components must be defined. You can import them, define them locally, or
pass them in later as props or via context.

```mdx {1,11,15} showLineNumbers
import { MyComponent } from 'my-components'

# My MDX page

This is a list in markdown:

- One
- Two
- Three

<section>And here is *markdown* in **JSX**</section>

Checkout my React component:

<MyComponent />
```

### JS Expressions

MDX supports JavaScript expressions inside curly braces, basically any JS
expression that evaluates to something that can be rendered:

```mdx
Two 🍰 is: { Math.PI ⁎ 2 }
```

### Import & Export

MDX also supports ESM import and export statements.

```mdx {3-5} showLineNumbers
import { ExternalComponent } from './components/...'

export const LocalComponent = props => (
  <span style={{ color: 'red' }} {...props} />
)

<External>external</External>

and a local one:

<Local>local</Local>.
```

You can also import data or export variables that can be used inside the
MDX file:

```mdx {2} showLineNumbers
import { Chart } from './chart.js'
import population from './population.js'
export const year = 2022

<Chart data={population} label={year} />
```

### MDX Content

The main content of an MDX file is exported as a component , this means you
can import it in other components and MDX files. Take `example.mdx` file:

```mdx showLineNumbers title="example.mdx"
export const Greet = ({ name }) => <h1>Hello {name}</h1>

<Greet name="Alice" />
```

You can now use the above MDX component in other files:

```mdx {1,5} showLineNumbers title="another.mdx"
import Example from './example.mdx'

# This is another mdx file

<Example />
```

You can also pass props to your MDX component and access them view the
`props` object inside your MDX file.

You can do a lot with MDX, as [Lee Rob](https://twitter.com/leeerob) put it
in this [blog post](https://nextjs.org/blog/markdown)

> You can use the same component-based principles from React and apply them
> to authoring Markdown documents

For further readings I recommend checking out the [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/)
docs.

### Layout

To add a layout to your MDX page, you can wrap the MDX page with your
layout component:

```mdx {15-17} showLineNumbers
import { MyComponent, BlogLayout } from 'my-components'

# My MDX Page with a Layout

This is a list in markdown:

- One
- Two
- Three

Checkout my React component:

<MyComponent />

export default ({ children }) => (
  <BlogLayout meta={meta}>{children}</BlogLayout>
)
```

### Frontmatter

Frontmatter is typically used to store meta data about a page. MDX does not
support frontmatter by default, however there are many solutions for adding
frontmatter support to MDX, such as
[gray-matter](https://github.com/jonschlinkert/gray-matter).

You can also use MDX's ESM `import/export` feature as an alternative to
frontmatter, you can export a meta object from within the `.mdx` file:

```mdx showLineNumbers
export const meta = {
  title: 'Article Title',
  excerpt: 'An article about such and such...',
  author: 'John Doe'
}

# {meta.title}
```

You might still prefer frontmatter though, as it can be extracted from the
file system before compiling your MDX file. For example:

```mdx showLineNumbers
---
title: Hello, there!
---

# Some title

some other content
```

Using gray-matter you can access the frontmatter:

```js {6} showLineNumbers
import fs from 'fs'
import matter from 'gray-matter'

export const getPostFrontMatter = slug => {
  const fileContent = fs.readFileSync(filePath, 'utf8')
  const { data, content } = matter(fileContent)
  return data
}
```

As mentioned earlier, MDX doesn't understand frontmatter by default, so we
need to tell it to ignore the frontmatter otherwise it'll show up in the
final output once compiled. We can do so by using a remark plugin,
[remark-frontmatter](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark-frontmatter). We
can add the plugin in our config file.

The only problem is that `remark-frontmatter` is ESM only package, which
means we can't use it in our current commonJS config file. Luckily, from
NextJS 12, ES modules are supported in the config file by renaming it to
`next.config.mjs`

```js showLineNumbers title="next.config.mjs"
import nextMDX from '@next/mdx'
import remarkFrontmatter from 'remark-frontmatter'

const withMDX = nextMDX({
  extension: /\.mdx?$/,
  options: {
    remarkPlugins: [remarkFrontmatter],
    rehypePlugins: []
  }
})

export default withMDX({
  pageExtensions: ['ts', 'tsx', 'js', 'jsx', 'md', 'mdx']
})
```

### Custom Components

So far we've seen how to use components in our MDX files by either
importing them or defining them locally. We can also pass components to our
MDX files using the `components` prop. It takes an object mapping component
names to components.

```mdx showLineNumbers title="example.mdx"
# This is a markdown file

It is using a custom link component

<CustomLink href="/">Home Page</CustomLink>
```

It can be imported from JavaScript and passed components like so:

```jsx {2,9} showLineNumbers title="example.jsx"
import Link from 'next/link'
import Example from 'example.mdx'

const components = {
  CustomLink: props => <Link {...props} />
}

const Home = () => {
  return <Example components={components} />
}

export default Home
```

One of the pleasant aspects of using markdown, is that it maps to native
HTML elements, we can pass our own custom components that map to HTML
elements to give our website a custom feel.

```jsx showLineNumbers
import Link from 'next/link'
import Image from 'next/image'
import Heading from './components/...'

const components = {
  h1: Heading.H1,
  h2: Heading.H2,
  // ...
  a: props => <Link {...props} />,
  img: props => <Image alt={props.alt} layout="fill" {...props} />
}
```

### MDX Provider

Passing components through props to each MDX file is fine but it can become
cumbersome. To solve this, we can use
[@mdx-js/react](https://mdxjs.com/packages/react/) which exposes a context
provider to pass our custom components through to all our MDX files.

To set this up:

1. Install the `@mdx-js/react` package
2. Specify the `providerImportSource` in your config file:

```js {4} showLineNumbers title="next.config.mjs"
const withMDX = nextMDX({
  // ...
  options: {
    providerImportSource: '@mdx-js/react'
  }
})
```

3.  Use `MDXProvider` to wrap your highest level MDX component or the
    `_app.js` and pass a components object as a prop so all MDX pages can
    access your custom components.

```js showLineNumbers
import Link from 'next/link'
import Image from 'next/image'
import Heading from './components/...'
import { MDXProvider } from '@mdx-js/react'

const components = {
  h1: Heading.H1,
  h2: Heading.H2,
  // ...
  a: props => <Link {...props} />,
  img: props => <Image alt={props.alt} layout="fill" {...props} />
}

function MyApp({ Component, pageProps }) {
  return (
    <MDXProvider components={components}>
      <Component {...pageProps} />
    </MDXProvider>
  )
}

export default MyApp
```

That's it for `@next/mdx`, you can get started with the
[with-mdx](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/examples/with-mdx)
example template to try out writing some MDX content.

Now let's look at `next-mdx-remote` package, how it's implemented and how
it differs from the first solution.

## `next-mdx-remote`

You can use [next-mdx-remote](https://github.com/hashicorp/next-mdx-remote)
to load MDX content through `getStaticProps` or `getServerSideProps`, the
same way you would load any other data.

```js showLineNumbers
import { serialize } from 'next-mdx-remote/serialize'
import { MDXRemote } from 'next-mdx-remote'

import Test from '../components/test'

const components = { Test }

export default function TestPage({ source }) {
  return (
    <div className="wrapper">
      <MDXRemote {...source} components={components} />
    </div>
  )
}

export async function getStaticProps() {
  // MDX text - can be from a local file, database, anywhere
  const source = 'Some **mdx** text, with a component <Test />'
  const mdxSource = await serialize(source)
  return { props: { source: mdxSource } }
}
```

This package exposes a function `serialize` which is intended to run server
side and a component, `<MDXRemote/>` to run client side.

`serialize` consumes a string of MDX and returns an object that is intended
to be passed into `<MDXRemote/>` directly.

You can also optionally pass options:

```js
serialize(source, {
  scope: {},
  mdxOptions: {
    remarkPlugins: [],
    rehypePlugins: [],
    hastPlugins: [],
    compilers: [],
    filepath: '/some/file/path'
  },
  parseFrontmatter: false
})
```

- The `scope` object is used to pass props to custom components used inside
  the MDX file. `scope` can also be passed to `<MDXRemote/>` component.
- `mdxComponent` options are passed directly to the MDX compiler
- `parseFrontmatter` indicates whether or not to parse the frontmatter from
  the mdx source

`<MDXRemote/>` consumes the output of serialize as well as an optional
components prop. Its result can be rendered directly into your component.
To defer hydration of the content and immediately serve the static markup,
pass the `lazy` prop.

```jsx
<MDXRemote
  compiledSource={string}
  components={object}
  scope={object}
  lazy={boolean}
/>
```

- `compiledSource` is exposed via the object return from `serialize`
  containing the compiled string
- `components` takes a components object to be used inside your MDX file
- `scope` exposed either through `serialize` or directly passed to the
  `<MDXRemote/>` is used to provide props to the components used inside the
  MDX file
- `lazy` takes a boolean and will defer hydration of the content if set to
  `true` to improve initial load time by immediately serving static markup.

#### Caveats

`import` and `export` statements cannot be used inside an MDX file. If you
need to use components in your MDX files, they should be provided as a prop
to `<MDXRemote/>`.

### MDX Provider

If you want to make components available to any `<MDXRemote/>` being
rendered in your application, you can use `<MDXProvider/>` from
`@mdx-js/react`. You can also replace HTML tags by custom components in the
same way as we did earlier.

## Summary

Using `next-mdx-remote` you are not limited to storing your MDX files
locally. Also you are not bound to the filesystem-based routing where
moving MDX pages around will also change the page's route (URL).

While this gives you flexibility on where you store your MDX files, it is
not as powerful as `next/mdx` when it comes to MDX features such as using
ESM `import/export`, JS expressions, exporting and importing MDX content as
components etc.

Therefore, if you have a lot of files that all import and use different
components, you may benefit from using `next/mdx` as `next-mdx-remote` is
very limited in that area.
